# About Solar

Solar is an admin system designed primarily for developers.
It allows developers to easily customize almost all aspects of it.
Developers are encouraged to program their own commands to add to Solar.

Solar comes with an easy to use API which allows developers to expand Solar even more.

Solar does not come with any commands besides the `example` command, however, you can download some pre-made commands on our [Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/KaE3sCM6p4) or at the bottom of this post
